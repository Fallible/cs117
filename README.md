# exampleProjects

/* Readme file*/

I am using this as a dumping ground for some of my simple projects.  Right now I am building fizzBuzz projects in different languages.

So far I have a simple python fizzBuzz and a c++ fizzBuzz.  I also used c++ to build an input file for processing.  Easy to assume that more will follow.
